# Tip Calculator 

## *Kevin Qian*

**Tippy** computes the tip and total amount for a bill. The app uses the base amount and tip percentage to calculate the amount owed, and it also describes the quality of service based on the tip.

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can enter in a bill amount (total amount to tip on)
* [x] User can enter a tip percentage (what % the user wants to tip).
* [x] The tip and total amount are updated immediately when any of the inputs changes.
* [x] The user sees a label or color update based on the tip amount.

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [x] Tint of tip seek bar now also changes color similar to that of label color.
* [x] Saves and loads last tip percent (apparent when close and restart app. If never executed before, default is 15%)
